# Hospital Management REST API

## Overview
A Spring Boot REST API to manage a hospital's staff and patients.
Designing a real-world entities, connect to PostgreSQL, perform CRUD, and write advanced native SQL queries with Spring Data JPA.

> ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Practice full-stack Spring Boot development with custom SQL.

##  Background
Our hospital has:

- **Staff**: doctors, nurses, admin staff â€” organized by department. 
- **Patients**: each assigned to a doctor. Patients have diagnoses and bills.

The REST API will:
1. Register staff & patients 
2. Query assigned patients for a doctor 
3. See billing statistics 
4. Identify doctors with many patients 
5. Report patients with bills higher than the average
